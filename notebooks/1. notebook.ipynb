    "The goal is to generate synthetic data and plot the images obtained by Reverse-Time migration in diﬀerent two-dimensional conﬁgurations, and to study the resolution and stability properties of the method with respect to measurement noise, and to compare with other methods."

    "We assume that the medium has speed of propagation $c_0 = 1$. The homogeneous two-dimensional Green's function $\\hat{G}_0(\\omega, x, y)$ is solution of $$\\Delta_x \\hat{G}_0 + \\omega^2 \\hat{G}_0 = -\\delta(x-y), \\quad x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$$ with the Sommerfeld radiation condition. It is given by $$\\hat{G}_0(\\omega, x, y) = \\frac{i}{4} H_0^{(1)}(\\omega |x-y|)$$ where $H_0^{(1)}$ is the Hankel function $$H_0^{(1)}(z) = J_0(s) + i Y_0(s)$$ and $J_0$ is the Bessel function of the first kind of order zero and $Y_0$ is the Bessel function of the second kind of order zero."
